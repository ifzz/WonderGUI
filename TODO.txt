FONT SYSTEM
===========

* WgBitmapGlyphs handle baseline and ascend correctly so we can mix bitmap glyphs with vector glyphs with good result.
* Separate struct and bitmap-cache for vector glyphs so we can get glyph info without touching the cache.
* TTF: Try to use multiple size-objects so we don't have to set size all the time.
* Handle underline in a better way, taking TTF offset and thickness into account.
* VectorGlyphs: Limit cache size!
* WgBitmapGlyphs: Currently uses linespacing for height... :(


TEXT
====

* Depricate WgTextTool::Ruler


GFXDEVICES
==========

* Editable surfaces.
* SDL: Correctly working tint.
* Support locking of only a region of a surface, could speed up WgSurfaceGL::Unlock() in combination with VectorGlyph generation quite a bit.
* Review WgSurfaceGL for consistency.


LAYOUT
======
* PosX()/PosY() should be renamed OfsX()/OfsY() with new PosX()/PosY() methods returning parent relative position, not origo offset?


GFXDEVICE
=========
* Optimize handling of cliprectangle.
