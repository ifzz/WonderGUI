BEFORE RELEASE
==============

* Sort function in WgOrderedLayout.

* Layout Class HBox.
* Layout Class Stack.
* Layout Class Grid.
* Layout Class VList (selectable).
* VList work with View (scroll_into_view etc).
* Layout Class Modal.
* WgCord -> WgCoord.
* Debug dirty rects.
* Tangentbordshantering i WgEventHandler.
* WgBlockSet externa fr√•n surface.
* WgGizmoMenu/MenuBar/ComboBox work with Layout Class Modal.

* Debug/finish layout class Table.
* Debug/finish layout class FlexGeo
* Debug/finish WgGizmoView (delete child gizmos where appropriate, not use signals etc).

- Bitmap-fonter.



PAPERCUTS
=========

* WgSurface should have a Size() method returning WgSize.
* WgGfxDeviceSDL should be able to take a SDL_Surface directly as canvas.
* Gizmos needs more constructors for convenience! WgGizmoPixmap could take the WgBlockSetPtr directly.
* More versions of WgSurface::defineBlockSet(), no need to force user to specify borders etc.


FONT SYSTEM
===========

* WgBitmapGlyphs handle baseline and ascend correctly so we can mix bitmap glyphs with vector glyphs with good result.
* Separate struct and bitmap-cache for vector glyphs so we can get glyph info without touching the cache.
* TTF: Try to use multiple size-objects so we don't have to set size all the time.
* VectorGlyphs: Limit cache size!
* WgBitmapGlyphs: Currently uses linespacing for height... :(

TEXTSYSTEM
==========
* Handle linebreaks so that cursor will fit on line if text is editable.
* Handle linebreaks so that EOL/EOF characters will fit if displayed.

underlining
-----------
* Handle underline in a better way, taking TTF offset and thickness into account.
* Start/stop select size and color correctly according to props.


CURSOR
======

* Change how cursor is stretched/scaled and/or offset. Offsets are in fixed pixelsizes but needs to be relative or something to work with the scaling.
* Make sure all parameters can be set through XML.
* Build cursor instance into text object (or somewhere similar).


GFXDEVICES
==========

* SDL: Correctly working tint.
* Support locking of only a region of a surface, could speed up WgSurfaceGL::Unlock() in combination with VectorGlyph generation quite a bit.
* Review WgSurfaceGL for consistency.


LAYOUT
======
* PosX()/PosY() should be renamed OfsX()/OfsY() with new PosX()/PosY() methods returning parent relative position, not origo offset?


GFXDEVICE
=========
* Optimize handling of cliprectangle.


SKINMANAGER
===========
* Implement serialization of BlockSet alternatives ( call WgAltRes::Serialize() from WgBlockSetRes::Serialize() )
* Allow activation_size of 0 throughout system, don't sort then... warn if combining alterantives with activation_size
  and no activation size in same BlockSet.
* Implement GetBlock( WgMode mode, WgSkinManager * pManager, WgSize destSize ). If skinmanager is present it decides alternative with
  destSize as input. If not alternative is decided by destSize.
* Use new GetBlock() from all Gizmos.
* Implement WgSkinManager-methods/rules.


GIZMO
=====
* Should not delete hook, just inform parent that it's disconnecting. Parent owns hook and it might not be a deletable object!

SIGNALS
=======
* Create signals that emit on KeyPress/KeyDown/KeyRepeat/KeyRelease regardless of the key and modifier.
