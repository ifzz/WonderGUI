WELCOME TO WONDERGUI!
=====================

(I will write some nice introduction text here someday, I promise! ;)




Directory structure
===================

build/
        Project files and makefiles for various build environments. This is
        also where intermediate files and generated output is stored.
		
doc/
        Contains a Doxyfile for building the documentation with doxygen.
        Will be populated with generated API documentation when running 
        doxygen.
		
resources/
        Various files such as fonts and bitmaps used by the examples.
		
src/
        The source tree for WonderGUI, graphics devices and examples.




Dependencies
============

The WonderGUI library does not have any dependencies beyond the standard
libraries supplied with any modern C++ compiler.

WonderGUI is however by default configured to use FreeType2 for text
rendering which adds a dependency on the FreeType2 development libary and
headers. To disable the use of FreeType2 (which will limit you to WonderGUI's
built-in bitmap-based fontsystem) you remove the WG_USE_FREETYPE define from
src/wg_userdefines.h. This will also prevent some examples from compiling.

The WonderGUI examples might have additional dependencies, most notably SDL2
(Simple DirectMedia Libary v2, www.libsdl.org) for handling user input and
displaying graphics on screen, as well as SDLImage2 for loading graphics files.
 
The various GfxDevices naturally have dependencies on the graphics systems
they are created for. Only the software-only device has no additional 
dependencies.



Happy Hacking, and let me know if you run into any problems!
